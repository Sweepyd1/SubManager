<h2 align="center">Project Description</h2>
<p>SubManager is a powerful and user-friendly Python tool designed to automate the management of subscriptions in GitHub. In today's world where audience interaction is key, it's important to keep your subscriptions up to date and keep up to date with changes in your network of contacts.</p>
<p>With SubManager, you can easily subscribe users who have subscribed to you and unsubscribe those who have decided to leave you. This makes it much easier to keep your subscription list up-to-date and allows you to focus on engaging with your audience rather than on mundane tasks.</p>
<p>SubManager's key features include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Cross-platform:</strong> The script is written in Python and runs on a variety of operating systems including Windows, macOS and Linux, making it accessible to a wide audience.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic Subscription:</strong> The script automatically subscribes to all users who have subscribed to your account, so you don't miss out on new subscribers.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatic unsubscribe:</strong> You can easily unsubscribe users who have unsubscribed from you, which helps keep your subscription list clean.</li>
    <li><strong>Exceptions to the algorithm:</strong> SubManager provides the ability to use two files: <code>ban_list_followers.txt</code> and <code>ban_list_following.txt</code>. These files allow you to add users to a blacklist, excluding them from automatic subscriptions and unsubscriptions, giving you complete control over who you want to leave out of the automated process.</li>
    <li><strong>Mutual Subscription Management:</strong> SubManager allows you to subscribe to new users, and if they do not reciprocate the subscription within a few days, the script will automatically unsubscribe from them. This feature is designed to help increase your audience by maintaining a list of engaged followers only.</li> </ul>
</ul>
